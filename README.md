### BrainAnalyzer

* brainapplibrary - the library
* svmrunner - program that runs a svm on a desired brain channel (pretty much the stuff we presented already)
* hellobrain - empty template that you can use to kickstart an a.i.. contains a list of rest and active phases from a desired channel that you can use in your a.i.


until a further revision, in order to change the path or name of the matlab file, you can just edit **line 20** in **brainapplibrary**
